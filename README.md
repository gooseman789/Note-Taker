  # Description
  My motivation for this project was to learn more about routes.  In addition to this, I also am looking to show practical use of routes.
  I built this project to display the skills I have learned in class.  
  This program solves a problem of needing notes written down, but not a good place to have them.
  I learned a lot about how to structure my routes for this project.
  
  # Installation
  I installed this by using the starter code provided and working forward from that spot.  That involved coding the different routes and paths for the API calls.
  
  # Usage
  This will be useful for people trying to hold the notes in a good location.  I also think this application will be useful in the future for showing my skills in these aspects.
  
  # Credits
  I started with cloned code that I received from our class.
